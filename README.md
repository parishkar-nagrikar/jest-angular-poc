# JestAnguler

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

**What is JEST?**

1. Jest is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.
2. It works with projects using: Babel, TypeScript, Node, React, Angular, Vue and more
3.** zero config**
4. Jest aims to work out of the box, config free, on most JavaScript projects.
5. **snapshots**
6. Make tests which keep track of large objects with ease. Snapshots live either alongside your tests, or embedded inline.
7. **isolated**
8. Tests are parallelized by running them in their own processes to maximize performance.
9. **great api**
10. From it to expect - Jest has the entire toolkit in one place. Well documented, well maintained, well good.
11. **FAST AND SAFE**
12. By ensuring your tests have unique global state, Jest can reliably run tests in parallel. To make things quick, Jest runs previously failed tests first and re-organizes runs based on how long test files take.
13.** CODE COVERAGE**
14. Generate code coverage by adding the flag --coverage. No additional setup needed. Jest can collect code coverage information from entire projects, including untested files.
15.** EASY MOCKING**

17. Jest uses a custom resolver for imports in your tests, making it simple to mock any object outside of your testâ€™s scope. You can use mocked imports with the rich Mock Functions API to spy on function calls with readable test syntax.
18. Jest is a JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase. It allows you to write tests with an approachable, familiar and feature-rich API that gives you results quickly.
19. Jest is well-documented, requires little configuration and can be extended to match your requirements.
20. Jest makes testing delightful.

**Steps to configure JEST in Angular Project : **

1. *Step 1*: Uninstall all karma jasmine packages 
2. *Step 2*: Remove test object from Angular.
3. *Step 3:* Delete karma.conf .js file and test.ts file
4. *Step 4*: npm i jest @types/jest jest -preset-angular
5. *Step 5*: Create setup.jest.ts file.
6. *Step 6*: Update tsconfig.spec.json file
7. *Step 7*: Add jest configuration in package.json 
8. *Step 8*: Add scripts in package.json to run JEST

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
